### Stage 5- Disinfection

**5.1 After performing the treatment, the physiotherapist should:** 
- disinfect:
  - the treatment device,
  - the place where the patient was sitting/lying,
  - the door handles.
- Wash the floor and surfaces which the patient may have come into contact with.
- Ventilate the treatment room (if there is a window).
- Put back in the designated area any disinfectants.
- Put disposable disinfecting materials into the red bag (medical supplies). 
- Take off and put in the red bag (medical supplies) disposable gloves and mask.
- Wash hands thoroughly and disinfect with liquid.
- Before the next patient, wear a new mask and a pair of gloves according to the procedure.

The greatest risk of contagion from the patient is when he or she arrives at the surgery, which is why the physiotherapist:
- informs the patient of the proper precautions to be taken;
- the distance of about 1.5 metres. 

Then, depending on the treatment, the patient gets into position and the physiotherapist also carries out the treatment at the furthest possible distance.
